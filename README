WeMesh

This repo is the master repo for the WeMesh project including all its dependencies as Git submodules:
- Paraview/VTK
- PCL (Point Cloud Library)
- LLVM/Clang

The goal is to manage version of the code and all its dependencies with one Git repository and to be able to rebuild and update everything easily.

My main target platforms are Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 and OS X El Capitan.
